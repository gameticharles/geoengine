/// Represents the bearing (direction) between two points, measured in degrees from the North.
///
/// This class extends the `Angle` class and provides functionality
/// for computing the forward and backward bearings between two geographical points
/// or simple 2D/3D points.
///
/// Bearing can be calculated using multiple methods:
/// - Initial Bearing: the direction you initially need to travel from the start point to the end point.
/// - Final Bearing: the direction you'd be traveling if you started at the end point and moved to the start point.
///
/// Example 1:
/// ```dart
/// var bear = Bearing(120);
/// var backBearing = bear.backwardBearing();
/// var trueBearing = bear.trueBearing();
/// var magBearing = bear.magneticBearing();
/// ```
///
/// Example 2:
/// ```dart
/// var point1 = LatLng(34.0, -118.0);
/// var point2 = LatLng(36.0, -116.0);
/// var bearing = Bearing.forwardBearing(point1, point2);
///
/// print(bearing);  // e.g. Bearing: 55.0Â°
///
/// var fb = bearing.forwardBearing;  // forward bearing is essentially the initial bearing
/// var bb = bearing.backBearing;
///
/// ```
