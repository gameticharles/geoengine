# GeoEngine Library Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the GeoEngine library. This page provides an overview and links to detailed documentation for each module within the library.

Whether you're performing complex geospatial calculations, working with various coordinate systems, geocoding addresses, conducting astronomical computations, or processing surveying data, these guides aim to help you effectively use GeoEngine's features.

## Table of Contents

Below is a list of available documentation sections for each module:

-   **[Core Calculations (Distance and Bearings)](./core/README.md)**
    -   Covers functions for calculating distances (Haversine, Vincenty, Great Circle), bearings, midpoints, destination points, intersection of paths, and rhumb line computations.

-   **[Coordinate Systems](./coordinate_systems/README.md)**
    -   Documentation on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Military Grid Reference System (MGRS), datum transformations, and map projection conversions.

-   **[Geocoding](./geocoding/README.md)**
    -   Details on converting addresses to geographic coordinates (and vice-versa) using different strategies like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and local datasets.

-   **[Astronomy](./astronomy/README.md)**
    -   An overview of the astronomy module, including calculations for celestial body positions, prediction of events (eclipses, moon phases, rise/set times), and coordinate transformations.

-   **[Julian Dates](./julian_dates/README.md)**
    -   Information on using the `JulianDate` class for astronomical time calculations, including conversions to and from standard `DateTime` objects.

-   **[Least Squares Adjustment](./least_squares_adjustment/README.md)**
    -   Guidance on using the `LeastSquaresAdjustment` class for solving overdetermined systems, statistical analysis of observations, and error propagation.

-   **[Levelling](./levelling/README.md)**
    -   Instructions on using the `Levelling` class for processing levelling survey data, calculating reduced levels, adjusting for misclosure, and performing checks.

Please refer to the individual README files linked above for detailed information on each module.
